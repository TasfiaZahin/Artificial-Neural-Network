# Artificial-Neural-Network

In this assignment, an artificial neural network is built from scratch and trained/tested on given data. Three types of activation functions (ReLu, Tanh, Sigmoid) are available and gradient descent algorithm is used for back propagation. User can specify number of layers in the network, number of neurons in each layer and learning rate.
